<div class="pco">
    <h1> Earth</h1>
    <P>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as 11 times brighter.</P>

    <h1> Mercury</h1>
    <P>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as 11 times brighter.

    <div class="Venus">   <div class="num4"></div> 
<div class="pco">
    <h1> Venus</h1>
    <P>Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus's thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.

    <div class="mars">   <div class="num5"></div> 
<div class="pco" >
    <h1> Mars</h1>
    <P>Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. There is strong evidence Mars was – billions of years ago – wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere.

    <div class="Jupiter">   <div class="num6"></div> 
<div class="pco" >
    <h1> Jupiter</h1>
    <P>Jupiter is more than twice as massive than the other planets of our solar system combined. The giant planet's Great Red Spot is a centuries-old storm bigger than Earth.

<div class="pco" >
    <h1> Saturn</h1>
    <P>Adorned with a dazzling, complex system of icy rings, Saturn is unique in our solar system. The other giant planets have rings, but none are as spectacular as Saturn's.

    <div class="Uranus">   <div class="num8"></div> 
<div class="pco" >
    <h1> Uranus</h1>
    <P> Uranus—seventh planet from the Sun—rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side.
    </P>

    <div class="Neptune">   <div class="num9"></div> 
<div class="pco" >
    <h1> Neptune</h1>
    <P> Neptune—the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun—is dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds. It was the first planet located through mathematical calculations.
    </P>

</div>
    <div class="moon">   <div class="num10"></div> 
<div class="pco" >
    <h1>Earth's Moon</h1>
    <P> The fifth largest moon in the solar system, Earth's moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.
