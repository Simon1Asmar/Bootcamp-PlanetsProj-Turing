          There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count orbiting <a href="#">our star:</a>

            href="#">Mars</a>. NASA's newest rover — Perseverance — landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The outer planets

          Beyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including longtime favorite <a
            href="#">Pluto</a>. Thousands more planets have been discovered beyond our solar system. Scientists call
          them <a href="#">exoplanets</a> (exo means "from outside").
